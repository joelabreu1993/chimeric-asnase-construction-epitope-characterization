#  Immunoinformatics Analysis of L-Asparaginase Chimeric Variants

This repository contains the scripts, input files, and computational workflows used in the doctoral research of **Joel Antonio Cordeiro de Abreu**, developed within the *Graduate Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences* (University of Brasília, Brazil) and the *Doctoral Program in Sciences – Cellular and Molecular Biology* (Universidad de La Frontera, Chile).

The project focuses on the **immunoinformatics characterization of native and chimeric L-asparaginase variants**, aiming to evaluate and compare immunogenic properties through epitope prediction, sequence engineering, and computational modeling.

##  Workflow Overview

The analyses performed in this study follow a structured computational pipeline composed of the following stages:

### **1. T-cell Epitope Prediction**
- Epitope prediction was carried out using **NetMHCII 4.0**, applying the **NetMHCIIpan 4.1 EL** algorithm.
- The sequences were fragmented into overlapping **15-mer peptides**, which were evaluated against the most frequent HLA class II alleles worldwide:
  - `HLA-DRB1*01:01`, `HLA-DRB1*03:01`, `HLA-DRB1*04:01`, `HLA-DRB1*07:01`,  
    `HLA-DRB1*08:01`, `HLA-DRB1*11:01`, `HLA-DRB1*13:01`, `HLA-DRB1*15:01`.
- Python scripts included in this repository were used to automate:  
  - epitope density calculations  
  - epitope aggregation per variant  
  - hit filtering and normalization between variants  
  - data export for statistical analysis and visualization  

### **2. Construction of Chimeric Variants**
- Chimeric L-asparaginase sequences were generated by replacing predicted immunogenic epitopes in parental enzymes.
- Custom Python scripts were implemented to:
  - identify candidate epitope regions  
  - perform amino acid substitutions  
  - generate multiple chimeric constructs  
  - validate sequence integrity  

### **3. Molecular Docking**
 The docking/ directory contains all scripts, configuration files, and structural inputs used for the validation, active-site identification, and molecular docking of native and chimeric L-asparaginase variants. This computational pipeline was designed to evaluate potential changes in ligand interactions resulting from sequence modifications.

The docking workflow includes the following steps:

3.1 Structural Validation
- Before performing docking, all protein structures were validated to ensure consistency and suitability for computational modeling. This step involved:
- Stereochemical analysis and Ramachandran assessment
- Geometry inspection of backbone and side chains
- Detection and correction of missing residues or atoms
- Removal of crystallographic artifacts or unwanted heteroatoms
- Standardization of PDB format for downstream tools
- Scripts located in docking/validation/ automate structure cleaning and preparation routines used throughout the project.

3.2 Active-Site Identification
- Active-site residues were identified by integrating:
- Catalytic site annotations reported in the literature
- Structural superposition across homologous L-asparaginase enzymes
- Pocket detection using external tools (e.g., fpocket, DoGSite, SiteMap)
- The docking/active_site_selection/ folder includes annotated PDB files, residue mapping, and helper scripts used to define the docking box/center for subsequent simulations.

3.3 Docking Simulations
- Molecular docking analyses were performed using tools such as GOLD and AutoDock Vina, depending on the variant set. This step included:
- Protein and ligand preparation
- Docking configuration
- Execution of multiple replicates
- Extraction of scores and ranking of poses
- Generation of consensus interaction profiles
- Automated Python scripts stored in docking/docking_runs/ were used to batch-process multiple variants, extract binding affinities, and export results for comparative analysis.

3.4 Contributors
The molecular docking pipeline—including structure validation, active-site selection, and the automation of docking routines—was developed by Prof. Maurício Homem-de-Mello and Gabriel Gonçalves, whose contributions were essential for designing and implementing the structural modeling framework used in this project.
